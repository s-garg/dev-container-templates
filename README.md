# Dev Container Templates

Opinionated templates for consistent dev environments using **Dev Containers** (VS Code or GitHub Codespaces). Each branch targets a specific stack with sensible defaults—ideal for reproducible development.

## Why Dev Containers?

In production, [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) makes builds and environments **predictable, portable, and repeatable**.
[**Dev Containers**](https://containers.dev/) bring the same reliability to **development**.

A Dev Container is a [**Docker container**](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) preconfigured with the required **tools, runtimes, and shell settings**. When used with [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it ensures the correct **dependencies, versions, and tooling** are always in place — avoiding conflicts between projects and removing the need for manual setup. For example, one project may require Python 3.12 while another depends on Python 3.9 — Dev Containers keep these environments **isolated** so they never interfere with one another.

This approach delivers **consistent environments** across platforms and team members, **isolates development** from the host system for clean and reproducible workspaces, and makes **onboarding effortless**: simply clone the repo and reopen it in a container.

Dev Containers replace the long “follow these steps to set up your environment” checklist with a single, reproducible setup that produces the same environment every time.


A **Dev Container** is a Docker container preconfigured with tools, runtimes, and shell settings. It delivers:

* Zero setup: clone + open in container, no local installs
* Consistency across platforms and team members
* Isolation from host environment—clean, reproducible workspace
* Easy onboarding — works the same in Codespaces and VS Code

Dev Containers eliminate the *“works on my machine”* issue.

## Structure

Each branch provides a complete `.devcontainer/` setup and `Dockerfile`, tailored for its specific environment.

**Common features across branches:**

* Lightweight Debian base image
* Non‑root `vscode` user (safer default for dev containers)
* Preconfigured VS Code settings via `devcontainer.json`

**Example layout:**

```
.
├── .devcontainer/
│   ├── devcontainer.json   # VS Code devcontainer configuration
│   └── Dockerfile          # Environment definition
├── README.md               # Branch-specific documentation
└── LICENSE                 # MIT License
```

👉 Check the README in each branch for language/framework‑specific details.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-garg/dev-container-templates.git
cd dev-container-templates
git checkout <branch>   # e.g., python, go, zsh, notebook, etc.
code .                  # open repo in VS Code
# then run "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
```

> 💡 If you have the [Dev Containers CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) installed, you can also use:
>
> ```bash
> devcontainer open
> ```
