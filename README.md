# Dev Container Templates

Opinionated templates for consistent dev environments using **Dev Containers** (VS Code or GitHub Codespaces). Each branch targets a specific stack with sensible defaults‚Äîideal for reproducible development.

---

## Why Dev Containers?

A **Dev Container** is a Docker container preconfigured with tools, runtimes, and shell settings. It delivers:

* Zero setup: clone + open in container, no local installs
* Consistency across platforms and team members
* Isolation from host environment‚Äîclean, reproducible workspace
* Easy onboarding ‚Äî works the same in Codespaces and VS¬†Code

Dev Containers eliminate the *‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù* issue.

## Features

* Preconfigured environments for Go, Java, Python, Jupyter, Claude, and zsh
* Based on lightweight Debian images
* Non-root `vscode` user for safer defaults
* Custom VS Code settings baked in via `devcontainer.json`
* Shell customization with **zsh** and plugins (where relevant)

---

## Structure

Each branch contains a full `.devcontainer/` setup and `Dockerfile`, customized for that environment.

Common features include:

* Non-root user (`vscode`)
* Custom VS Code settings in `devcontainer.json`

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-garg/dev-container-templates.git
cd dev-container-templates
git checkout <branch>   # e.g., python, go, zsh, notebook, etc.
code .                  # open repo in VS Code
# then run "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
```

> üí° If you have the [Dev Containers CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) installed, you can also use:
>
> ```bash
